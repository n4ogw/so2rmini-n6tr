TODO List

- There are some corner cases with auto start send edits while the other Tx
is sending that need to be worked out.  If works fine if you don't make
any edits it seems.

- Need to interpret Cryptic CW characters

- Need to make F1 and F2 work in S&P mode

- Changing code speed will stop CW message on other radio.

- Will updating the callsign in the exchange window work for free?


CHANGE LOG

15-Aug-2022

  - Made PageUp/PageDn work to change CW speeds in real time
  - Made TX indicator stay when changing code speed
  - Enabled numeric keypad PageUp/Dn keys to control CW speed
  - Started implemention of SearchAndPounce Mode - not completed yet.

16-Aug-2022

  - Implemented AltZ to recompute initial exchange based upon call window.
    This perhaps works a little different from AltZ in the main program
    as you can use it in any QSOState.  If the exchange window is not up,
    it will put it up for you but not change the QSO state.  It will only
    put up an intiial exchange if there is one for the callsign - otherwise,
    it will leave the Exchange Window alone.  Not sure if this is the best
    way - but give it a try.
